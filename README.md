# Extract_TROPOMI_Shapefiles

This repo is for code related to extracting data from TROPOMI NC files using shapefiles and/or clipping nc files using shapefiles.

## Missing files

Just to double check that we got all of the files, as some files may have 0 soundings for our region of interest or we may have run out of memory, run check_missing.R to generate a list of potential missing files. Then run the main script again with that file list.
